// AIM PROVIDER -- the per-game half of the aim solution, plus the orchestrator that composes it.
//
// The seam: the CORE (aim_solve_logic.h) is engine-free and picks the strategy from caps(); the
// PROVIDER owns every engine-specific fact behind these methods. The core hands down a CONVERGED
// setpoint; the provider actuates it. Direct drive and convergence compose -- actuate the converged
// aim, never the raw hand aim.
//
// Why this exists: MCC spans six Blam generations (CE 2001 .. H4 2012, H4 a 343 fork) plus Saber
// Anniversary renderers on CE/H2, so each title exposes its aim state, shot origin, and collision
// differently. A single hardcoded solution is impossible; this interface absorbs the divergence so
// the core stays one tested body of code. See the Engineering Vault concept
// "multi-engine-aim-provider-interface".
//
// This header is engine-free: it declares an abstract contract over the pure types in
// aim_solve_logic.h, plus a pure orchestrator that drives a provider. The concrete providers (e.g.
// src/dll/reach_aim_provider.*) are engine-bound.

//                      eye/origin delta, and bend the setpoint here in the core (no-op if not live).

//                      intent (relocation/fixed-range/direction-only move the shot, not the angles).
